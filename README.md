**Relaxy! is a Discord bot developed by MattFor#9884 / mattfor (me) in 2019.
It is designed to provide a variety of features, commands, and fun interactions for Discord server members. With over 100 commands, this bot has something for everyone:
games, moderation tools, music streaming, and many more.***

Do not expect too much, as when I started this project I had 0 knowledge of JS.
It's a kind of passion project that's supposed to keep my JS in check.

## Slash Commands

Relaxy! also supports the use of slash commands. Initiate them by typing `/commandname`. If these commands don't work, follow the provided link in the bot's messages for help.
