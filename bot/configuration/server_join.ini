Relaxy can play music, moderate your server, generate images and more!
To get started, type **=help** to get a list of commands!

Some of Relaxy's more advanced commmands require these permissions to work:
`'MOVE_MEMBERS'`,`'MANAGE_ROLES'`,`'ATTACH_FILES'`,`'EMBED_LINKS'`,
`'EMBED_LINKS'`,`'BAN_MEMBERS'`,`'MANAGE_CHANNELS'`,`'SEND_MESSAGES'`.

Thank you for taking your time to read this, hope you enjoy Relaxy!
